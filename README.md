# SimpleChat
Simple chat on Qt with client and server in one application

Chat works when transferring messages between applications on the same computer.
The chat also works when transferring messages between applications on computers in the local network.
It is not known whether this works on the global network.

It is possible to select the address and connection port.
When the server goes down, all clients go down with it.

Example of work:
